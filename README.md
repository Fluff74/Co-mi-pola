# Co mi pola

*Co mi pola* is an idea that I had while working on Eternal Veil for the Global Game Jam 2026. It's a game about love being a universal language, that can be understood by all people, even if this game depicts it
in a way that is outwardly nonsensical, and lacking explicit written expression.

The game is intended on being created in MonoGame, and it should (hopefully!) satisfy four of the diversifiers for the Global Game Jam, since I kind of wanted to be an overachiever. Although my idea did not land
with my team, that does not mean I cannot create it myself :D

## What's the game?

The game is about playing five randomized minigames centered around your loved one, and the bond between the player and them. Your movement, choices, and colors within each minigame will be used to generate
a picture at the end of the game that abstractly represents everything that happened in the short play session. This picture can be downloaded to the computer to be saved.

## The Constraints
I want to try and satisfy four different diversifiers from the Global Game Jam, even though this is being produced after the Jam has ended. Here are the constraints:

### Life isn't black and white
At the start of each playthrough, the game randomly selects a colour palette that determines the visual style of environments, characters, and UI elements.

### Masterpiece
The game culminates in the production of a piece of art that can be displayed on a wall.

### Cartridge Ready (my favorite!)
Your game should be under 10 MB.

### Undefined Language
All in-game text, symbols, spoken words, and written language must use a completely made-up language.

All constraints come from the Global Game Jam 2026, which can be found [here](https://globalgamejam.org/global-game-jam-2026-diversifiers-have-arrived).

## How?

Since the game is themed around love, I would like to try and have it finished before Valentine's Day. I am willing to extend the project timeline if I must, but ultimately I would like it to be finished before
the end of February.

In order to finish the game before Valentine's Day, I would need to be working on a pretty tight schedule of effectively twelve days to go from zero to one hundred, so here is my planned pipeline:

**February 1st:** Create the repository and then go to sleep. I just finished a Game Jam today already.
**February 2nd:** Create the project, and set up all of the basic functionality, such as the finite state machine, RenderTarget, palette randomizer, etc.
**February 3rd:** Build some more basics. Import fonts, create the basic player, the player's romantic partner, buttons, and some simple ground that can be stood on.
**February 4th:** Create a functional main menu, the ability to open the settings menu, and the base scene object for minigames.
**February 5th:** Make five empty minigame scenes, with smooth functional transitions between each of them, and create the end screen, with the option to download the image and return to the main menu.
**February 6th:** Create the first minigame.
**February 7th:** Create the second minigame.
**February 8th:** Create the third minigame.
**February 9th:** Create the fourth minigame.
**February 10th:** Create the fifth minigame.
**February 11th:** Planned buffer day to finish and polish minigames, and how they play into the image generation at the end.
**February 12th:** Implement audio, and make sure volume settings are in full working order.
**February 13th:** Planned buffer day to polish and finalize anything that may not have been finished in prior days, and to upload the game!
**February 14th:** Celebrate Valentine's Day :)

Hopefully this won't need to change too much, and it's properly scoped for a team of one person to create this entire project!
